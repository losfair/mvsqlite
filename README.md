## Features

- **Full feature-set from SQLite**: mvsqlite integrates with SQLite using either a custom [VFS](https://www.sqlite.org/vfs.html) layer or [FUSE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filesystem_in_Userspace) at your choice. Since it is a layer "below" SQLite itself, all of SQLite's features are available.
- **Time travel**: Checkout the snapshot of your database at any point of time in the past.
- **Scalable reads and writes**: Optimistic, fine-grained concurrency with [BEGIN CONCURRENT](https://www.sqlite.org/cgi/src/doc/begin-concurrent/doc/begin_concurrent.md)-like semantics.
- **Get the nice properties from FoundationDB, without its limits**: [Correctness](https://apple.github.io/foundationdb/testing.html), [really fast and scalable](https://apple.github.io/foundationdb/performance.html) distributed transactions, synchronous and asynchronous replication, integrated backup and restore. Meanwhile, there's no [five-second transaction limit](https://apple.github.io/foundationdb/known-limitations.html) any more, and a SQLite transaction can be ~39x larger than FDB's native transaction.
- **Drop-in addition**: Use `LD_PRELOAD` or a patched `libsqlite3.so` to plug mvSQLite into your existing apps. [Read the docs](https://github.com/losfair/mvsqlite/wiki/Integration)

## Releases

Grab the latest binaries from the [Releases](https://github.com/losfair/mvsqlite/releases) page. You can also [build your own binaries](#contributing) to run on a platform other than x86-64.

## Quick reference

Check the single-page [mvSQLite Quick Reference](https://blob.univalent.net/mvsqlite-quick-reference-v0-2.pdf) for common operations with mvSQLite.

## Try it

Install FoundationDB:

```bash
wget https://github.com/apple/foundationdb/releases/download/7.1.15/foundationdb-clients_7.1.15-1_amd64.deb
sudo dpkg -i foundationdb-clients_7.1.15-1_amd64.deb
wget https://github.com/apple/foundationdb/releases/download/7.1.15/foundationdb-server_7.1.15-1_amd64.deb
sudo dpkg -i foundationdb-server_7.1.15-1_amd64.deb
```

Download the binaries:

```bash
curl -L -o ./libmvsqlite_preload.so https://github.com/losfair/mvsqlite/releases/download/v0.2.0/libmvsqlite_preload.so
curl -L -o ./mvstore https://github.com/losfair/mvsqlite/releases/download/v0.2.0/mvstore
chmod +x ./mvstore
```

Run `mvstore`, the server-side half that should be colocated with the FoundationDB cluster in production:

```bash
RUST_LOG=info ./mvstore \
  --data-plane 127.0.0.1:7000 \
  --admin-api 127.0.0.1:7001 \
  --metadata-prefix mvstore \
  --raw-data-prefix m
```

Create a namespace with the admin API:

```bash
curl http://localhost:7001/api/create_namespace -i -d '{"key":"test"}'
```

Build `libsqlite3` and the `sqlite3` CLI: (note that a custom build is only needed here because the `sqlite3` binary shipped on most systems are statically linked to `libsqlite3` and `LD_PRELOAD` don't work)

```bash
wget https://www.sqlite.org/2022/sqlite-amalgamation-3390300.zip
unzip sqlite-amalgamation-3390300.zip
cd sqlite-amalgamation-3390300
gcc -O2 -fPIC --shared -o libsqlite3.so ./sqlite3.c -lpthread -ldl -lm
gcc -O2 -o sqlite3 ./shell.c -L. -lsqlite3
```

Set environment variables, and run the shell:

```bash
export RUST_LOG=info MVSQLITE_DATA_PLANE="http://localhost:7000"

# "test" is the key of the namespace we created earlier
LD_PRELOAD=../libmvsqlite_preload.so LD_LIBRARY_PATH=. ./sqlite3 test
```

You should see the sqlite shell now :) Try creating a table and play with it.

## Contributing

mvsqlite can be built with the standard Rust toolchain:

```bash
cargo build --release -p mvstore
cargo build --release -p mvsqlite
make -C mvsqlite-preload
```

Internals are documented in the [wiki](https://github.com/losfair/mvsqlite/wiki).
